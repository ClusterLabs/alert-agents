# NAME

alert_smtp_filtered.sh - Sample SMTP alert agent for pacemaker with filtering

# SYNOPSIS

pcs alert create id=filtered-smtp \
 path=/var/lib/pacemaker/**alert_smtp_filtered.sh** options \
 **email_sender=**noreply@example.com **RHA_alert_kind=**"fencing"


# DESCRIPTION

**alert_smtp_filtered.sh** is a sample alert agent which implements filtering by
 matching the value of pacemaker's CRM_alert_kind variable that is set when an 
 alert is generated. This agent was built for a client who wished to send 
 receive alerts whenever resources are relocated,.

By default, the email client the script expects is sendmail.

# OPTIONS

**path=**_/var/lib/pacemaker/alert_smtp_filtered.sh_

This is the path to the alert agent on the nodes' filesystems - the path should
 match to wherever you've installed the file. By default they're placed in 
 /usr/share/pacemaker/alerts/ when installing from rpm, and they're usually 
 manually placed in /var/lib/pacemaker/ for runtime when the agents are 
 configured.

**email_sender=**_user@example.com_

This is what the agent will use as the "FROM" field on email alerts

**RHA_alert_kind=**_"fencing,node,resource,attribute"_

This option sets the RHA_alert_kind variable in the alert_smtp_filtered alert 
 agent, to specify the criteria on which alerts to allow to send to the email 
 recipient.

Note that otherwise-unspecified alert types will be sent to the recipient 
 regardless of the filter specification.

_fencing_

These alerts are generated when a node is fenced, whether automatically or 
 automatically.

_node_

These alerts when a node is suspended, unsuspended, rebooted, joins the 
 cluster, etc. 
    
_resource_

These alerts are generated when a resource is started, stopped, or fails to 
 start. 
    
_attribute_

These alerts are generated when a resource's attribute is changed. 

# INSTALLATION

Place alert_syslog.sh in pacemaker lib dirctory (typically /var/lib/pacemaker)
 chown it the pacemaker user and group (typically hacluster:haclient on a 
 default install); chmod it 0750

```
[root@nodea ~]# cp /usr/share/pacemaker/alerts/alert_smtp_filtered.sh.sample \
  /var/lib/pacemaker/alert_smtp_filtered.sh
[root@nodea ~]# chown hacluster:haclient /var/lib/pacemaker/alert_smtp_filtered.sh
[root@nodea ~]# chmod 0750 /var/lib/pacemaker/alert_smtp_filtered.sh
```

# EXAMPLES

The following example will send alert emails whenever a node is fenced and also 
 unhandled alerts, but not node, resource, or attribute alerts, and send the 
 alert emails to sysad@example.com

```
[root@nodea ~]# pcs alert create id=filtered-smtp \
 path=/var/lib/pacemaker/alert_smtp_filtered.sh options \
 email_sender=noreply@example.com RHA_alert_kind="fencing"
[root@nodea ~]# pcs alert recipient add filtered-smtp \
 value=sysad@example.com@example.com  
[root@nodea ~]# 
```

This example will send alerts of kind node, resource, attribute, and "unhandled"
 alerts, but not fencing notifications, and the alert emails will go to 
 monitor@example.com:

```
[root@nodea ~]# pcs alert create id=filtered-smtp \
path=/var/lib/pacemaker/alert_smtp_filtered.sh options \
email_sender=noreply@example.com RHA_alert_kind="node,resource,attribute"
[root@nodea ~]# pcs alert recipient add filtered-smtp \
value=monitor@example.com  
[root@nodea ~]# 
```
